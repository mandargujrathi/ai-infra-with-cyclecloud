SLURM is one of the most popular and widely used open-source workload managers for AI, HPC, and cloud computing. With Slurm, you can run large-scale parallel and distributed applications across a set of compute nodes. It provides features such as job scheduling, resource management, fault tolerance, and power management. Many of the world's top supercomputers, research institutes, universities, and enterprises use Slurm.
However, setting up and managing Slurm clusters on the cloud can be challenging and time-consuming, especially if you're not familiar with the cloud environment or the Slurm configuration. You need to handle tasks such as provisioning and scaling compute nodes, installing and updating Slurm software, configuring network and storage, monitoring cluster health and performance, and troubleshooting issues. These tasks can distract you from your core research or business objectives and reduce the productivity and efficiency of your AI and HPC workloads.

** 1.1 The Spoke: Application Landing Zone -- AI Infra ** \

!(https://github.com/mandargujrathi/ai-infra-with-cyclecloud/AIInfra-LZ.jpg?raw=true)
 

Azure CycleCloud Workspace for Slurm will be used in the AI Infra Landing Zone. To deploy the AI Infra landing zone accelerator we can use the Azure Marketplace or the Azure CLI. The following resources in your Azure subscription as shown in the architecture below: \
•	a VNET and subnets to host CycleCloud, compute, Bastion and storage,\
•	a VM with CycleCloud pre-configured and a System Managed Identity with the proper roles assigned to create resources,\
•	a Network Security Group with rules defined and attached to the subnets,\
•	a storage account used by CycleCloud,\
•	(optionally) an Azure Bastion and its public IP,\
•	(optionally) a NAT Gateway and its public IP in order to provide outbound connectivity,\
•	(optionally) an Azure NetApp Files account, pool, and volume and its subnet,\
•	(optionally) an Azure Managed Filesystem and its subnet, and \
•	(optionally) a VNET Peering to a provided hub VNET.\

** 1.2 Plan CycleCloud Workspace for Slurm (CCWS) deployment** \\
You have two deployment plans for Azure CycleCloud Workspace for SLURM: \
•	Greenfield environment: The deployment provisions all the needed resources.\
•	Brownfield deployment: You provide the existing resources.\
When you deploy, grant the Azure user account the following roles:\
•	Contributor on the Subscription\
•	User Access Administrator on the Subscription\
•	Optional: permission to register a Microsoft Entra application\
 
Note:\
We recommend that you predeploy a Hub virtual network to connect to your enterprise network if you don't already have one. This hub can accommodate a VPN Gateway and an Azure Bastion. The CycleCloud Workspace for Slurm environment is a spoke that's peered during deployment. Contact Azure HPC Support if VPN or Azure Bastion don't meet your requirements or if your organization blocks them.

*Plan 1: Greenfield deployment* \
A greenfield deployment creates the following resources and role assignments:\
•	A resource group.\
•	The virtual network and its ccw-cyclecloud-subnet and ccw-compute-subnet subnets.\
•	The ccw-cyclecloud-vm virtual machine (VM), NIC, OS, data disks, and a system assigned managed identity.\
•	A user assigned managed identity to access the CycleCloud storage account.\
•	A uniquely named storage account for CycleCloud projects and a private endpoint in the ccw-cyclecloud-subnet.\
•	The nsg-ccw-common network security group (NSG).\
•	Contributor, Storage Account Contributor, and Storage Blob Data Contributor roles at the subscription level for the CycleCloud VM system assigned managed identity.\
•	Optionally, a bastion, the AzureBastionSubnet subnet, and the bastion-pip public IP.\
•	Optionally, a NAT gateway named ccw-nat-gateway and public IP pip-ccw-nat-gateway.\
•	Optionally, an Azure NetApp Files account, pool, and volume with subnet hpc-anf-subnet.\
•	Optionally, an Azure Managed Lustre Filesystem with subnet ccw-lustre-subnet.\
•	Optionally, a virtual network Peering.\
•	Optionally, a Private Endpoint to an existing Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instance.\\

*Plan 2: Brownfield deployment* \
In a brownfield deployment, you provide existing resources for:\
•	The virtual network and subnets in which you deploy the environment.\
•	Filesystem Storage for the user's home directories and other filers, such as external NFS mount points or Azure Managed Lustre Filesystem (AMLS).\
•	An Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instance for Slurm Job Accounting.\
•	A registered Microsoft Entra ID application for Open OnDemand authentication.\
•	A User-Assigned Managed Identity used by the registered Microsoft Entra ID application for the federated credentials.\\
If you bring your own virtual network, follow these prerequisites:\
•	A /29 cyclecloud subnet for the CycleCloud VM.\
•	A compute subnet for the nodes, where you create the scheduler, authentication, and compute nodes.\
•	When using Azure NetApp Files, use a dedicated netapp subnet with the Microsoft.NetApp/volumes delegation as documented in Azure NetApp Files.\
•	When using Azure Managed Lustre Filesystem, use a dedicated lustre subnet with a CIDR based on the storage capacity to provision as documented in Azure Managed Lustre.\
•	If deploying a Bastion, use a dedicated BastionSubnet as documented here.\
•	Your NSGs should allow communications between subnets as defined in the bicep/network-new.bicep file.\
